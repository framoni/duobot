# duobot

A Duolingo bot for farming XP in timed practice mode, written in Python.


Only works with italian as client language. I may extend it at least to english, if not please create an issue. 
 

## why?

Mainly to unlock the XP achievement and to obtain first place in Diamond League 

## setup

Install Python 3.8 and run

<code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code>

## usage

<code>python duobot.py --username USERNAME --password PASSWORD [-l]</code>

**USERNAME** and **PASSWORD** are your Duolingo login credentials<br>
**-l** is an optional argument used to run the bot in headless mode (the web browser will not be shown)
